## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

- What type of sources did you identity and want to explore? How would you justify it in reference to the brief set? Think about the focus of the brief.
- What type of sources do you want to avoid? How could these kinds of sources be detrimental to the user experience, immersion or implementation?

# Example

As I have done research regarding the audio identity and developing audio assets for this project in previous formative assignments. I wanted to look into specific Unreal and Wwise systems that will help create a more immersive experience. I wanted to focus on official documentation to improve my ability to learn new techniques without explicit instructions.

I also wanted a creative source to help develop the parachute audio assets and learn how it should function within the game’s narrative.
```

#### Sources

- An opening paragraph about the source stating the author, developer or organisation, this paragraph should explain the source's influence, credentials, critical reception, awards, reputation or any issues with the source. For example, if the source is not reputable. If the source is a game, the issues that occurred during development or if had a poor launch.
- List the aspects analysed in reference to the current task.
- An ending paragraph stating what you enjoyed or disliked, what you agreed with or not agree with.

# Example Documentation

I wanted to create an emitter which takes advantage of spread and focus, which was a technique I learned from a previous assignment where the spatialisation of an object changes depending on distance. I also wanted to work specifically with a `Spline Component` to encapsulate the entire ship with an “Ocean Emitter”. This led me to read the Unreal Blueprints API References and Wwise 3D Positioning documentation (Unreal Engine Blueprint API Reference | Unreal Engine 5.4 Documentation | Epic Developer Community, s.d., AudioKinetic Inc, s.d.).

I found a Blueprint node called “Find Location Closest to World Location" which returns a `Vector3` on the spline position closest to another `Vector3`, I believe this can help move the emitter towards the player(Finding time of given results from (Find Location Closest to World Location) from Splines - Programming & Scripting / Blueprint, 2023).

I found the Unreal documentation clear and easy to navigate, however it was much harder to find specific nodes unless you are familiar with the naming conventions used by Unreal, such as “World Location” and the API documentation is separated from the property references. The Wwise documentation on the other hand is much easier to navigate as they have core topics such as “Using Sounds and Motion to Enhance Gameplay” and examples of how they can be applied, which the unreal documentation lacked. 

# Example Game Source

Just Cause 3 is an action-adventure game developed by Avalanche Studios, it features a mechanic where the player can navigate the open world with the use of a parachute and a wingsuit(Just Cause 3, 2015).

The wind becomes more prominent in the mix and its volume and speed is based on the player's velocity when using the wingsuit or parachute. It is not too overwhelming during action sequences to ensure audio responses can be clearly heard.

I found their implementation and choice great for the context of their narrative and game mechanics. However, for the sequences featured in the assignment, it is more “cinematic” allowing for a different approach for the mix and can be “exaggerated” to drive its narrative function.

*A Fire Particle Effect*

I created a fire particle effect that included flames, smoke, embers, and heat distortion. I also made it glow and illuminate the surrounding area. To achieve a more realistic fire movement, I carefully edited the emitters' properties, fine-tuning various settings to simulate the behavior of real fire.

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

- What did not work well? What parts of the assignment that you felt did not fit the brief or ended up being lacklustre.
- What did you think went very well? Were there any specific aspects you thought were very good?

### What would you do differently next time?

- Are there any new approaches, methodologies or different software that you wish to incorporate if you have another chance?
- Is there another aspect you believe should have been the focus?
