## Research

- What type of sources did you identity and want to explore? How would you justify it in reference to the brief set? Think about the focus of the brief.
- What type of sources do you want to avoid? How could these kinds of sources be detrimental to the user experience, immersion or implementation?

#### Sources

- An opening paragraph about the source stating the author, developer or organisation, this paragraph should explain the source's influence, credentials, critical reception, awards, reputation or any issues with the source. For example, if the source is not reputable. If the source is a game, the issues that occurred during development or if had a poor launch.
- List the aspects analysed in reference to the current task.
- An ending paragraph stating what you enjoyed or disliked, what you agreed with or not agree with.

###### Fire Particle Effect Unreal Engine Tutorial

"Unreal Particle Effects Tutorial", published by Epic Games on their official Unreal Engine learning platform, the source provides a comprehensive guide to creating and utilizing particle effects within the Unreal Engine. Epic Games, the developer of Unreal Engine, is widely regarded as a leader in the gaming and development industry. Their engine has powered numerous critically acclaimed games, including Fortnite and Gears of War, and has set industry standards for visual fidelity and real-time rendering. The tutorial benefits from Epic's authoritative voice and deep expertise in game development tools, ensuring that users can trust the contentâ€™s accuracy and relevance. Unreal Engine itself has won several awards for innovation and is widely adopted in game design, film production, and beyond. While the tutorial does not seem to have any notable issues, as with many technical guides, users may encounter challenges depending on their prior experience with the engine and particle systems. Nonetheless, this tutorial remains a valuable resource for beginners and professionals alike.

In reference to the current task of designing and implementing a realistic fire particle effect using Unreal Engine's Niagara or Cascade particle system, the Unreal Particle Effects Tutorial from Epic Games provides key insights into several aspects critical to achieving this goal. The tutorial explores the fundamental components of particle systems, such as emitters, materials, and behaviors, all of which are essential for creating dynamic fire effects. It also covers key parameters like particle lifetime, size, and color, which are important for simulating the flickering and fading nature of fire. Additionally, the tutorial delves into optimizing performance, an important consideration when implementing particle effects in a real-time interactive environment. Special attention is given to lighting and environmental interactions, which help enhance the realism of fire effects. These aspects will guide the development process, from basic design to more advanced techniques, ensuring the final fire particle effect is visually appealing and suitable for gameplay contexts.

I found the Unreal Particle Effects Tutorial by Epic Games to be an enjoyable and insightful resource, especially for understanding the fundamentals of particle systems. I appreciated how the tutorial was well-structured and accessible, providing clear instructions that are easy to follow, even for users who are relatively new to the engine. The emphasis on flexibility, allowing creators to choose between Niagara and Cascade, was another aspect I agreed with, as it caters to different skill levels and project needs. However, I would have liked more detailed examples or real-world applications for complex effects, as the tutorial primarily focused on the basics. While I agreed with the importance of optimizing particle systems for performance, I felt that some sections could have expanded further on advanced techniques to achieve greater realism. Overall, the tutorial was effective, but more in-depth exploration would enhance its usefulness for those seeking to push particle effects to a higher level.

*A Fire Particle Effect*

I created a fire particle effect that included flames, smoke, embers, and heat distortion. I also made it glow and illuminate the surrounding area. To achieve a more realistic fire movement, I carefully edited the emitters' properties, fine-tuning various settings to simulate the behavior of real fire.
