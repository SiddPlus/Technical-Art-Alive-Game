## Research

- What type of sources did you identity and want to explore? How would you justify it in reference to the brief set? Think about the focus of the brief.
- What type of sources do you want to avoid? How could these kinds of sources be detrimental to the user experience, immersion or implementation?

#### Sources

- An opening paragraph about the source stating the author, developer or organisation, this paragraph should explain the source's influence, credentials, critical reception, awards, reputation or any issues with the source. For example, if the source is not reputable. If the source is a game, the issues that occurred during development or if had a poor launch.
- List the aspects analysed in reference to the current task.
- An ending paragraph stating what you enjoyed or disliked, what you agreed with or not agree with.



## Implementation

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

- What was the process of completing the task at hand? Did you do any initial planning?
- Did you receive any feedback from users, peers or lecturers? How did you react to it?

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

- What did not work well? What parts of the assignment that you felt did not fit the brief or ended up being lacklustre.
- What did you think went very well? Were there any specific aspects you thought were very good?

I encountered significant difficulty in locating relevant sources for the task. Despite my efforts to search through various websites and videos, the material I found was either limited in scope or not directly applicable. Consequently, I had to adapt my approach by broadening my search criteria and seeking alternative perspectives, though it remained a time-consuming process. I would have preferred if this task included a programming component. Incorporating programming would have made the project more engaging and allowed me to apply technical skills in a practical context, making the experience more rewarding. Additionally, programming could have introduced new learning opportunities, particularly through problem-solving and coding challenges, which would have deepened my understanding of the topic. Without it, the task feels somewhat limited, and I miss the chance to work directly with code as part of the process.

The implementation of the physics-based door was successful.Each stage progressed smoothly, resulting in a door mechanism that functions as intended within the environment. I was able to accurately incorporate the necessary physics interactions, ensuring that the door responds realistically to player actions and environmental forces. This aspect of the project allowed me to apply and refine my knowledge of physics principles in game development, and I'm pleased with how effectively the door enhances the interactive experience.

### What would you do differently next time?

- Are there any new approaches, methodologies or different software that you wish to incorporate if you have another chance?
- Is there another aspect you believe should have been the focus?
