## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

- What type of sources did you identity and want to explore? How would you justify it in reference to the brief set? Think about the focus of the brief.
- What type of sources do you want to avoid? How could these kinds of sources be detrimental to the user experience, immersion or implementation?

#### Sources

- An opening paragraph about the source stating the author, developer or organisation, this paragraph should explain the source's influence, credentials, critical reception, awards, reputation or any issues with the source. For example, if the source is not reputable. If the source is a game, the issues that occurred during development or if had a poor launch.
- List the aspects analysed in reference to the current task.
- An ending paragraph stating what you enjoyed or disliked, what you agreed with or not agree with.

## Linear Interpolation Research

### Explanation of the Lerp Function

The Lerp (linear interpolation) function is a mathematical formula used to create smooth transitions between values.

$$ 
Lerp(a, b, t) = a + t(b âˆ’ a)
$$

a: Starting value (the value at t = 0)
b: Ending value (the value at t = 1)
t: Interpolation factor, typically a value between 0 and 1.

### Examaple

a is red and b is blue:

t =  0, the color will be red.

t = 0.25, the color will be reddish-purple shade.

t = 0.5, the color  will be purple.

t = 0.75, the color will be bluish-purple shade.

t = 1, the color will be blue

### Real-World Examples

- Blending Textures: When creating smooth transitions between two textures, Lerp can be used to blend their colors or patterns. For instance, blending a grassy texture into a rocky texture based on player movement or environmental changes.

- Moving Objects: Lerp is often applied to interpolate the position of objects over time. For example, moving a character smoothly from one point to another in a scene. By incrementally adjusting the character's position based on the value of t, the movement appears fluid and natural.

- Creating Smooth Animations: Lerp is frequently used to create smooth animations in character movements, camera transitions, and UI elements. For example, easing the camera from one position to another during a cutscene can create a more cinematic experience.

- Color Gradients: Developers often use Lerp to create color gradients in user interfaces or environmental lighting. For instance, changing the sky color from day to night by interpolating between different colors based on the time of day.
