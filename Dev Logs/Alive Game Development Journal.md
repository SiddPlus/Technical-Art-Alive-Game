## Research

- What type of sources did you identity and want to explore? How would you justify it in reference to the brief set? Think about the focus of the brief.
- What type of sources do you want to avoid? How could these kinds of sources be detrimental to the user experience, immersion or implementation?

#### Sources

- An opening paragraph about the source stating the author, developer or organisation, this paragraph should explain the source's influence, credentials, critical reception, awards, reputation or any issues with the source. For example, if the source is not reputable. If the source is a game, the issues that occurred during development or if had a poor launch.
- List the aspects analysed in reference to the current task.
- An ending paragraph stating what you enjoyed or disliked, what you agreed with or not agree with.

###### Behavior Trees Unreal Engine

The Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine documentation by Epic Games provides an in-depth guide for using behavior trees within Unreal Engine, a feature crucial for AI-driven character actions in game development. Epic Games, known for its Unreal Engine software, is highly regarded in the industry for providing powerful tools and extensive documentation that support both novice and expert developers. Their documentation is generally well-received, as it offers practical, accessible guidance. Despite the occasional criticism for its complexity, Epic’s resources are trusted for their accuracy and technical rigor.

I appreciated the Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine documentation for its detailed, step-by-step approach to creating AI behaviors, making a complex topic more accessible. The use of visual aids and clear examples is a plus, enhancing understanding. However, certain sections could benefit from more beginner-friendly explanations, as some technical concepts may feel dense for newcomers. Overall, the guide is robust and highly informative, aligning well with best practices in AI development, though a more layered approach could help engage a wider audience.

"Navigation System in Unreal Engine" is provided by Epic Games, the renowned developer behind Unreal Engine, one of the most widely used game engines in the industry. Epic Games has built a reputation for creating cutting-edge tools and technologies for game development, with Unreal Engine being a cornerstone of modern game design. The documentation is a reliable and authoritative resource for developers working with Unreal Engine, reflecting the company's commitment to providing comprehensive and up-to-date information. Epic Games has received numerous accolades for Unreal Engine, including awards for its groundbreaking contributions to the gaming and interactive media industries. The Navigation System documentation, specifically, plays a crucial role in guiding developers through the creation of AI pathfinding and navigation solutions within games, a fundamental aspect of game design. While generally well-regarded for its technical depth and clarity, the documentation can sometimes be overwhelming for beginners due to the complexity of the engine's systems, and occasional updates may lead to slight inconsistencies in older content. Nevertheless, Epic Games' continued support and regular updates ensure that the source remains a vital reference for professionals in the field.

I found the "Navigation System in Unreal Engine" documentation from Epic Games to be an invaluable resource for understanding how to implement AI pathfinding and navigation within Unreal Engine. The depth of information provided, from basic concepts to advanced techniques, makes it an excellent reference for both beginners and seasoned developers. I particularly appreciated the clear explanations and the practical examples that help to demystify the complexities of navigation meshes and AI behavior. However, I did find some sections to be dense with technical jargon, which could make it challenging for newcomers to fully grasp the material without additional context. While I agree with the overall accuracy and usefulness of the content, I think more beginner-friendly examples and a clearer breakdown of the concepts could improve the accessibility for those less familiar with Unreal Engine. Nonetheless, the source offers a thorough, authoritative guide that is undeniably helpful for anyone looking to work with the navigation system in Unreal Engine.

###### Super Mario Galaxy

Nintendo’s Super Mario Galaxy, developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo and released in 2007, is one of the most acclaimed entries in the iconic Super Mario series. Directed by Yoshiaki Koizumi and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, the game received widespread critical acclaim for its innovative gameplay, unique gravitational mechanics, and visually stunning design. Its development showcased Nintendo's dedication to pushing the boundaries of 3D platforming, particularly with its creative use of physics and planetary exploration. Super Mario Galaxy received numerous awards, including Game of the Year from several publications, and is often considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Although it was technically ambitious, its launch was smooth and devoid of major technical issues, setting a high standard for the franchise and for games on the Wii console.

Super Mario Galaxy introduces unique gameplay mechanics centered around gravity and spherical platforming, distinguishing it from previous Mario titles. Players navigate Mario across small, planetoid-like environments, each with its own gravitational pull, allowing him to run upside-down and around curves in ways not seen in traditional platformers. The game's core mechanics include precise platforming, jumping, and combat, with Mario equipped with familiar moves like the triple jump, ground pound, and spin attack, which helps him interact with objects and defeat enemies. Additionally, the game incorporates motion controls via the Wii Remote, allowing players to collect “Star Bits” (used as in-game currency) and execute various actions, like aiming to shoot Star Bits at foes. Mario's journey takes him through a variety of themed galaxies, each with distinct gravity-based puzzles, environmental hazards, and level design challenges that exploit the 3D spherical landscapes. These mechanics, combined with gravity-defying platforming, create a fresh, immersive experience within the Mario universe, elevating traditional platforming with spatial dynamics.

Playing Super Mario Galaxy was an unforgettable experience, primarily due to its imaginative level design and unique gravity mechanics, which transformed familiar platforming gameplay into something fresh and exhilarating. I particularly enjoyed how the game balanced accessible controls with complex environments, keeping the gameplay consistently engaging without overwhelming players. The use of gravity as a core mechanic was both innovative and well-executed, making exploration feel intuitive yet challenging. However, while the motion controls were an interesting addition, there were moments when they felt slightly gimmicky or unnecessary, particularly when aiming Star Bits at enemies. Overall, I agree with the widespread praise for Super Mario Galaxy—its ambitious design, polished mechanics, and the sheer joy of discovery make it a landmark in gaming. The game’s impact and Nintendo’s inventive approach more than justify its reputation as a modern classic.
