# General Tips

- Use plenty of images and videos to demonstrate your point. You can embed YouTube tutorials, your own recordings, etc.
- Always reference! Even documentation, tutorials and anything you used for your assignment. Use an inline reference for the sentence and a bibliography reference at the end.
- Word count is not important, you can also chose to use bullet points. As long as it is clear and readable, the format your decide to use can be flexible.
- You are free to use AI but please ensure you have made a note in the declared assets, for example if you have a script called Test.cs , you should note that AI was used to in the creation of this script. You can use a bullet point list for each asset used like:

The following assets were created or modified with the use of GPT 4o:
- Test.cs
- AnotherScript.cs
- Development Journal.html
